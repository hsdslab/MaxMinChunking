Every morning, she would wake up at dawn and wander into the forest behind her house. One day, while exploring, she stumbled upon an old, mysterious book hidden beneath a willow tree.

Deep within the cave, she found a shimmering lake, its waters reflecting light in a way that seemed magical. By the lake's edge, there sat an ancient stone pedestal on which lay a crystal key.\n",
